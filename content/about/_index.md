I'm a Principal Engineer at [RVU](https://www.rvu.co.uk/), based in Bath, UK. My day-to-day is in platform engineering - distributed systems, cloud infrastructure (mostly AWS), Kubernetes, and developer tooling.

## What I'm Into

I spend most of my time in Linux (NixOS specifically), Rust, and Go. I'm currently learning Rust by building small games with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) as a way to explore the language beyond typical backend work.

I like declarative configuration and reproducible environments. My [NixOS config](https://github.com/DewaldV/nixos) manages multiple machines and I run a homelab with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) on a Raspberry Pi alongside several NixOS boxes.

## The Homelab

I'm always tinkering with my home automation setup - currently planning smart heating with Zigbee TRVs and running proper cable throughout the house. I lean heavily toward self-hosting and local control over cloud-dependent services, and I'm gradually working on de-Googling.

## Other Interests

- Gaming on Linux
- Boxing and hiking
- Tinkering with my Framework laptop
- Doom Emacs

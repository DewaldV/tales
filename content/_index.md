Starting out with some basics, let's get a bit of structure.

1. A Landing page with a list of articles and a hero image
2. An initial post with something about something
3. Published to my domain

Let's list out some ideas for future posts:

- Zoom on Sway
- Something on NixOS, maybe combined with the Framework?
- Nix for Rust Development, a Guide?
- Bevy and Rust
- Writing a blog with Hugo (so meta)
- Choosing to make time for the things you want to do in life
- Something about books I've read recently?
- Helldivers 2, tweaking performance on 7900XT on Linux
- Linux Gaming stuff in general
- Something on repair, maybe along with re-fixing the PSU for the rice cooker?
- Setting up Kolide on NixOS
- Gaming on Linux, retrospective from the last two years on the platform (PopOS, NixOS)
- Framework laptop retrospective, 6 months in.
- Something about infrastructure on Kube maybe. Aligned with the big project this year (CP).
- De-googling with Proton (Series)
  - Mail management with Proton
  - Drive management with Proton
  - Wireguard VPNs with Proton
- Setting up Steam with Gamemode and Mangohud

## Motivations: Why even bother?

## Getting Started with acceptable Cloud services: Proton, Tailscale
 - Tailscale foundation for securing and exposing services
 - 

## The most important cloud functions: Email, Docs/Notes, Photos, Storage
 - Proton Mail, personal domain
 - Proton Drive, an acceptable compromise for now
 - Syncthing + WebDAV, note sync with no cloud
 - Syncthing Android app discussion (mention iOS app quality)

# Taking back control: Branching out into the physical with Home Automation

## A tirade on privacy, choosing your suppliers
 - Reolink

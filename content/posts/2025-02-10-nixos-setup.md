## Work in progress

This post is a placeholder — full content coming soon.

The plan is to walk through setting up NixOS as a daily-driver developer workstation: from installation to a fully declarative, reproducible system configuration.

Topics to cover:

- Why NixOS (and why it's worth the learning curve)
- Partitioning and installation
- The basics of `configuration.nix`
- Home Manager for dotfiles and user-level packages
- Flakes: pinning inputs and building reproducible environments
- Sway / Wayland compositor setup
- Lessons learned and rough edges

## Work in progress

This post is a placeholder — full content coming soon.

The plan is to document the process of removing Google's services from day-to-day life: moving email, calendar, search, photos, and cloud storage to self-hosted or privacy-respecting alternatives.

Topics to cover:

- Why bother (and why it's harder than it sounds)
- Email: Migrating away from Gmail
- Search: life after Google Search
- Photos: self-hosted alternatives
- Calendar & contacts: CalDAV/CardDAV
- DNS: blocking trackers at the network level
